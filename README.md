# AI-Hand-Tracking-Mouse


# Abstract

This Hand-Tracking mouse is an application that allows users to use mouse commands using gestures. This application access the computer's webcam and gets input from the hand gestures. With the help of the gestures, users can able to take control over the mouse and system. This reduces the use of carrying physical mouse. This Hand-Tracking application runs under a variety of image processing algorithms.

# Problem it solves and Inspiration behind it

* This project enables users to reduce the usage of physical wired mouse or wireless mouse which require a surface to keep on it and work

* This also resolved the use of mouse in meetings and confrences where we need to move from one place to another to access mouse control

* This can also be developed in such a way where physically challenged people can also get accessed to computer by gestures
